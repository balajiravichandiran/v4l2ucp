v4l2ucp - A universal control panel for all Video for Linux Two (V4L2) devices.

This is port of an original v4l2ucp graphical V4L configuration tool to a
non-graphical ros node. Original version was written Scott J. Bertin.

This software is written in C++ using ROS2 libraries on Linux. It reads a
description of the controls that the V4L2 device supports from the device,
and presents the user with ros2 service for adjusting those controls.
It allows for controlling multiple devices. There is an easy way
to reset one or all the controls to their default state.

It will try to open /dev/video0 if nothing else was specified.
If no devices can be opened, the program will exit.

Use colcon to build.
